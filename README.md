# Impact-of-Fog-on-Sensor-Performance
1 Goal
The overall aim of this work is to explore how fog affects sensor measurements. This
involves analyzing data collected from three different sensors in varying conditions. The
goal is to create graphs for each sensor’s recordings in both clear and foggy situations,
comparing these graphs to determine the impact of fog on sensor readings. The objective
is not just to observe the influence of fog but also to provide a clear understanding of
how and if it alters the accuracy of sensor measurements.

2 Approach used

In examining the impact of fog on the sensors, Our approach involves a systematic evaluation for both Lidar and Radar systems. Utilizing the provided .csv files from distinct
folders, namely ’c building pedestrian clear anon’ and ’c building pedestrian fog anon,’
we aim to meticulously assess each sensor’s behavior. By leveraging the coordinates
(x, y, z) ∈ R
, we compute the distances to facilitate comprehensive analysis. Our task unfolds in
two steps: initially sorting all measurements during recordings based on distance criteria
and then constructing histograms to illustrate the distributions. This methodical process
will be executed for each sensor across the two recording scenarios—clear and foggy
conditions—to gauge the influence of fog on sensor measurements accurately.
